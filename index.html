            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Anna Turner. I graduated from Northwest Missouri State University with my bachelor's and master's in science of education. I am in my 6th year of teaching. I decided I was ready for a career change and I am currently enrolled in the EdX Coding Boot Camp through the University of Kansas. I am highly motivated to learn more about web development, have a positive growth mindset attitude, and I'm eager to be a valuable asset to your team!
