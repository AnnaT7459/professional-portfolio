# <Professional Portfolio>

## Description

I created this project because I want potential employers to view my portfolio of my work samples so they can assess whether or not I am a good candidate for an open position. I learned a lot about CSS throughout this project, as well as a growth mindset. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
